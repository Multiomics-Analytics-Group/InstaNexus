## Introduction

InstaNexus is a generalizable, end-to-end workflow for direct protein sequencing, tailored to reconstruct full-length protein therapeutics such as antibodies and nanobodies. It integrates AI-driven de novo peptide sequencing with optimized assembly and scoring strategies to maximize accuracy, coverage, and functional relevance.

This pipeline enables robust reconstruction of critical protein regions, advancing applications in therapeutic discovery, immune profiling, and protein engineering.

## Features

- üß¨ Supports De Bruijn Graph and Greedy-based assembly
- ‚öóÔ∏è Handles multiple protease digestions (Trypsin, LysC, GluC, etc.)
- üßπ Integrated contaminant removal and confidence filtering
- üß© Clustering, alignment, and consensus sequence reconstruction
- üîó Integrates with external tools:
  - [MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) for fast clustering
  - [Clustal Omega](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) for high-quality alignment
- üìä Output-ready for downstream analysis and visualization
